## 1. Kinematic part
Directly run main.m file.  
In main.m file, there are two parts, can run them separately or togather.
All other functions have very detail explanation.

## 2. Dynamic part
The files can be ran directly. The file can be used to derive NE equations and LE equation theoretically. All variables are subject to replace with real numerical value. 
Comparation between N-E and L-E
